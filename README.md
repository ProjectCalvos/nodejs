# NodeJS application

This application contains a simple socket for listen in port 3000.

For run the aplication:

-   Clone de repository (DONT CHANGE THE GITIGNORE FILE)

-   Download nodejs

-   Run the command npm install in the folder where you have cloned the repository (This command create a folder with all modules)

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   And in the end, run the command npm start

If the app crash, it is because of the version of your nodejs (for run websocket you need v4.5.0 or higher)

So.. run the next commands:

    -   curl sL http://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash

    -   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


=======
-   And in the end, run the command node index.js (in the future, i will change for npm start)


All changes will be sent to slack :)
