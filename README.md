# NodeJS application

This application contains a simple socket for listen in port 3000.

For run the aplication:

-   Clone de repository (DON'T CHANGE THE GITIGNORE FILE)

-   Download nodejs

-   Run the command npm install in the folder where you have cloned the repository (This command creates a folder with all the modules)

-   And in the end, run the command npm start

If the app crashes, it is because of the version of your nodejs (to run a websocket you need v4.5.0 or higher)

So... run the next commands:

    -   curl sL http://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash

    -   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs



-   And in the end, run the command node index.js (in the future, i will change for npm start)


All changes will be sent to slack :)
